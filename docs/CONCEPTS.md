## Core

### Phaser Game Engine

Version 3 of Phaser was used, which was published these days (version 3.1 released today, on 19.02). Its documentation is mature, although currently in a state of flux.

Here are the reference documents we suggest to refer to:

* [Phaser 3 API](https://phaser.io/phaser3/api/) _The official Phaser 3 API documentation_
* [Phaser 3 Source code](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/master/src) _The ultimate reference_
* [Phaser 3 Examples](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples) _a repository with a collection of Phaser 3 code snippets and examples_

Look at the [`SceneManager`](https://phaser.io/phaser3/api/scene-manager) documentation in the API, as a starting point.

:warning: Beware! Many sample code and question/answers on StackOverflow and the Internet still refer to Phaser 2, as it is quite popular. Keep it in mind when reading sample code and check the Phaser 3 API docs for eventual changes.
