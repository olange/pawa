# Concepts

## Overview

The animation is built with the Phaser Game Engine.

## Core

### Phaser Game Engine

Version 3 of Phaser was used, which was published these days (version 3.1 released today, on 19.02). Its documentation is mature, although currently in a state of flux.

Reference documents we suggest to refer to:

* [Phaser 3 API](https://phaser.io/phaser3/api/) _the official Phaser 3 API documentation_
* [Phaser 3 Source code](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/master/src) _the ultimate reference_
* [Phaser 3 Examples](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples) _a repository with a collection of Phaser 3 code snippets and examples – also available [online](https://labs.phaser.io)_.

Look at every one of the [Systems](https://phaser.io/phaser3/api/systems), especially the [Scene Manager](https://phaser.io/phaser3/api/scene-manager) and [Boot process](https://phaser.io/phaser3/api/boot) system parts, in the API documentation, as a good starting point.

Later, have a look at the [Actions](https://phaser.io/phaser3/api/actions), [Game Objects](https://phaser.io/phaser3/api/gameobjects), [Geometry Objects](https://phaser.io/phaser3/api/geometry) and [Math functions](https://phaser.io/phaser3/api/math) to get a grip on everything you might use to build a game.

:warning: Beware! Many sample code and question/answers on StackOverflow and the Internet still refer to Phaser 2, as it is quite popular. Keep it in mind when reading sample code and check the Phaser 3 API docs for eventual changes.
